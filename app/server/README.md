# Getting the server running locally

## Without Nodemon

If you want to run the server without nodemon, then use: `npm start`

## With Nodemon

Having to restart the server after every change can be tedious. We use nodemon to automatically restart the server and show our most recent changes.

To run the server locally with nodemon, type this into the terminal: `npm run dev`
