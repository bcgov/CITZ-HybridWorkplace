# CITZ HybridWorkplace


## Introduction

This is the project repo for the 2022 CITZ IMB "Hybrid Workplace" product. We are currently in our inception phase, come back often as content is constantly being added
As part of that initiative we are exploring the need and benefit of a tool.

## Problem Statement

The RISE  team provides a forum for the exchange of information and best practices for  civil servants wishing to improve their leadership skills. Particpants need a platform for curated resources that are easy to locate, can be commented on and discussed. Currently there are a number of different tools that fill parts of the identified need which leads to more duplication and over time a lack of use and orphaned information.

## Hypothesis

Developing a web application to support RISE and other common interest teams will assist improving team collaboration and the exchange of best practices.

Utilizing a platform that allows easy contribution of content in a moderated environment can facilitate effective exchange of information and provide streams of information to other platforms through the use of APIs.

## Goal

The goal of the CITZ Co-op 2022 Hybrid-Workplace project team is to create a modern web application as a tool for <TBD> to <TBA>.

Objectives include:

- Apply modern application development methodology based on AGILE principles
- Create a modern web application that is intuitive and easy to use
- Store project and reporting information in a central repository such as a database
- Host the solution in the BC Dev Exchange's container environment
