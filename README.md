# Application Name

## What am I?

I am a template repo for use by the platform services team to encourage consistency in documentation and repo layout. For those using me, do not feel like you are *required* to adhere to this layout if you feel something better would suit the needs of your application or service. Find more information about this template [here](https://github.com/bcgov-c/platform-services-docs/blob/main/repo-organization.md)

**Sadly, topics are not automatically imported when creating a repository from a template. Ensure you include the following topics:**
- `citz`
- `devops`
- `platform-services`
- `supported` / `unsupported`
- plus any additional topics that may be appropriate

Please use this README as a template for your own README, including all the same information, as appropriate.

Consider including your namespace name(s) in this section, so others supporting this tool know where to look.

## Contact Info

Relevant rocketchat channels, maybe some outside docs, vendor support portals, etc.

## Vendor Info

If this is a deployment of a vendored product, include some links to relevant repos and documentation.

## Repo Overview

Tell me where to find important stuff in this repo and provide some info about the layout.
